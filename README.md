# Social Media Web Site

In this project I designed a simple website where we can find publications published by users, each user has his profile and what publications he liked, same for the publication it contains its category and the number of likes it gained.
I implemented object-oriented programming in PHP and relational databases (MySQL connection) to establish the diffrents mechanism of the back-end, html and css for the front-end.

- Every user should be identified with a username and a password 
- publications and profiles are only seen by the connected users 
- we can add new user to the website
- we can publish a new publication by a connected user
- any user can like any publication, just once
- when a user likes a publication, the number of likes increase
